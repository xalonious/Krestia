## Features

- Group ranking: Manually rank your staff all through discord.
- Basic moderation commands: Kick, ban, and manage your discord server members.
- Some games: Play games with your Discord server members.

2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file, fill it out like the example.

## Configuration

You may need to change some IDs in the code itself to match your Discord server and Roblox group. You can find these IDs in the Discord and Roblox developer portals.

## Usage

Once the bot is running and everything is correctly configured, the program will begin registering all commands to your discord server. Once that is done, all of the commands can be viewed within discord.
